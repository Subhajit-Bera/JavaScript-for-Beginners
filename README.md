# Java Script

JavaScript was invented by [Brendan Eich](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enIN928IN928&sxsrf=ALiCzsa5HE3IOykriUDC74nW0l2ynA5NYQ:1662830393286&q=Brendan+Eich&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgVuLUz9U3MDE2KrZ8xGjCLfDyxz1hKe1Ja05eY1Tl4grOyC93zSvJLKkUEudig7J4pbi5ELp4FrHyOBWl5qUk5im4ZiZnAAD6oLmNUwAAAA&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnlKf33Yr6AhXD1TgGHbWlCnwQzIcDKAB6BAgEEAE)
in 1995.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows client-side scripts to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

If we want to perform any sequence of steps,calculation or implement any algorithm then we use JavaScript to do that.


## What can JavaScript do?

* JavaScript can add new HTML and change existing HTML from DOM.
* It can even react to any events (actions).[Response from server,keyboard press,mouse movement]
* It can also manage the AJAX requests (GET or POST request).
  **Ajax Request:** Asynchronous JavaScript And XML used to change the content of a page dynamically without reloading it.
* JavaScript can get and set cookies and use local storage.
## What Can’t In-Browser JavaScript Do?
* JavaScript cannot read or write to and from computer hard disk without user permissions. 
* The browser does not allow the JavaScript of any website to collect the AJAX information of the other website because it generates the error of the same origin policy.
* To summarize, JavaScript can only access the permitted resources but cannot access your documents on personal computers. 
These strict policies are developed to make sure that your computer is safe.

## What Makes JavaScript a Unique language?
* The most important thing that makes it a unique language is, it has a complete integration of HTML and CSS. They provide it with a lot of extra support.
* Also it provides the use of simple APIs (Application Programming Interface).
* It also supports the major modern browsers which are enabled by default. If you turn off the feature of JavaScript in the browser, you cannot access any website.

## WHAT IS DOM ?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, **programming languages can interact with the page.**

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

**For example**, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list of all the <p> elements in the document

## Variables In Java Script 
**Java is a dynamic type language. Means we don’t need to specify the data type.
The set of types in the JavaScript language consists of primitive values and objects**.

**1.Primitive Values**(All types except objects define immutable values)
* Boolean type
* Null type
* Undefined type
* Number type
* BigInt type
* String type
* Symbol type
